# Solutions to two soliton equations

Through two different finite difference schemes, solitary waves are simulated. The equations studied are the Kortewegâ€“De Vries equation and the Burgers equation.

 Both a gaussiand and a cosine initial condition are tested. Kabusky' scheme leads to more stable solutions.

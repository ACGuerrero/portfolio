# Solutions to two soliton equations

## The three equations

Through two different finite difference schemes, solitary waves are simulated. The equations studied are the following:
1. Kortewegâ€“De Vries equation: the classic soliton equation
2. Burgers equation: a shock wave equation
3. Inviscid Burgers' equation: a special case of the Burgers equation

## Discretization

Two different finite different schemes are used. The firs one uses a second-order central difference, while the second one is the leap-frog method developed by Zabusky and Kruskal in 1965.

## Initial conditions

Both a gaussian and a hyperbolic secant are used as initial conditions, with varying initial speed and width.

## Noether's theorem

By applying Noether's theorem to the equation's Lagrangians at least two conserved quantities are found. The simulations confirm these calculations.
